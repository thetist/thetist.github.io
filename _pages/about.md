<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">"Iâ€™m looking for Ph.D. positions for Fall 2026."</span>

Hi there, I'm **Minchan** ðŸ‘‹

I'm an undergraduate at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/), majoring in Computer Science. I'm currently working in [SNU Vision & Learning Lab](https://vision.snu.ac.kr/), advised by [Prof. Gunhee Kim](https://vision.snu.ac.kr/gunhee/). Iâ€™ve also had the opportunity to collaborate on research projects with [Prof. Yejin Choi](https://yejinc.github.io/) at [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/) and [Prof. Niloofar Mireshghallah](https://mireshghallah.github.io/), [Prof. Akari Asai](https://akariasai.github.io/), and [Prof. Graham Neubig](https://www.phontron.com/) at [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu/).

My research focus lies in the intersection of machine learning, databases, and cryptography: **machine learning** (privacy-preserving machine learning, long-term memory systems, generalist imitation agents), **databases** (vector databases, approximate nearest neighbor, multimodal data compression), **cryptography** (homomorphic encryption, multi-party computation, private information retrieval)

My vision is to develop a **secure long-term memory system** inspired by the human hippocampusâ€”one that continuously collects, stores, and utilizes an individualâ€™s lifetime of action data. Through this work, I aim to create an **generalist imitation agent** that shares your memories and acts on your intent. To achieve this, the system must (i) seamlessly capture everything you see and hear, (ii) securely store your memories, and (iii) think, speak, and act like you.

If you share these interests or would like to explore potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out!
