### About Me

Hello 👋

I am currently an undergraduate student at Seoul National University.

My primary research focus lies in the intersection of **machine learning**, **applied cryptography**, and **computational neuroscience**.

I am deeply interested in developing a secure cloud memory system inspired by the human hippocampus—one that continuously gathers, stores, and utilizes an individual’s complete lifetime of egocentric data.

Through this work, I aim not only to augment human memory, but also, over time, to capture and reflect the fundamental aspects of human identity.

### Research Interests

**Machine Learning**  
(1) Efficient and Scalable Semantic Search  
(2) Instruction-Conditioned Imitation Learning

**Applied Cryptography**  
(1) Homomorphic Encryption (HE)  
(2) Private Information Retrieval (PIR)

**Computational Neuroscience**  
(1) Principles of How the Hippocampus Stores and Recalls Memories  
(2) Principles of Learning in the Biological Brain

If you share these interests or would like to explore potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out!
