Hi there 👋 I'm Alan.

I’m an undergraduate student in Computer Science and Engineering at Seoul National University dedicated to practical and high-impact research.

My primary research focus lies in the intersection of **machine learning**, **applied cryptography**, and **computational neuroscience**.

I am deeply interested in developing a secure cloud memory system inspired by the human hippocampus—one that continuously gathers, stores, and utilizes an individual’s complete lifetime of egocentric data.

Through this work, I aim not only to augment human memory, but also, over time, to capture and reflect the fundamental aspects of human identity.

More specifically, my research interests include:

1. **Machine Learning**  
(a) Encrypted Semantic Search  
(b) Encrypted Fine-Tuning

2. **Applied Cryptography**  
(a) Homomorphic Encryption (HE)  
(b) Private Information Retrieval (PIR)

3. **Computational Neuroscience**  
(a) Principles of How the Hippocampus Stores and Recalls Memories  
(b) Principles of How the Brain Learns and Generalizes Knowledge

If you share these interests or would like to explore potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out!
